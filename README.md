## Introduction
***
Film production began in 1900 by [Charles PathÃ©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Path%C3%A9), while the first film theatre to be introduced was "The Nickelodeon" in Pittsburgh(United States) 1905. Since then, film production and theaters have increased spontaniously till the 20th centuary, where film industry worldwide has revenue of around 77B, [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/5431/film-production-worldwide/#topicOverview). The revenue genereted from Movies is usually accumulated from the following sources ;
- Merchandising
- Television Broadcats
- Home video
- Theatre Exhibitions.

However, out of all these sources theatre exhibitions (aka box office) is the most used measure to asses the  the success of a movie, because of data availability compared to the other revenue sources.
Movies produced are usually categorised according to the style, theme or scenes associated with the movie, such categories are called **genres**, few examples of movie genres are **Actio, Thriller, Drama, Horror and Comedy**.

## Data Understanding
***
The datasets used in this project were sourced from various movie databases and website such as [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) , [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) and [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/). They contain various attributes of intrests such as movie: ***titles , gross sales , production studios , year of production , produers , actors*** and **directors*** .  
The datasets that have been used are;
> The `bom.movie_gross.csv`, where each row represents a particular movie and its corresponding attribute. The data set contains 3387: movies and 5: movie atributes which include; `title`, `studio`, `domestic_gross`, `foreign_gross` and `year`.

> The `im.db` is SQLite database of IMDB data, that contain 8 tables that are link together using primary and foreign keys. Each table contains different information corresponding to particular movie title and movie id  found in the `movie_basics` table. From this  database we are going to create two tables which will contain the requred attrubutes:
- `movie_basics` table, which is a join of the `movie_basics` and `movie_ratings` tables and will have the following attributes {`movie_id`, `runtime_minute`, `primary_title` and `genres`}

- `persons` table, which is a join of the  `persons` and `principlas` tables inorder to have the following attributes {`person_id` , `primary_name`, `movie_id` and  `category`}

## Data Preparation
***
The data was checked for missing values duplicates and placeholders of missing data. The missing values were handled by dropping all the rows with them while duplicates were not found in our data. New columns created from transforming existing columns and those columns that were not in their appropriate data type were cleaned and converted into their approbriate data type
