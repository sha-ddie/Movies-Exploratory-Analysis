## Introduction
***
Film production began in 1900 by [Charles PathÃ©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Path%C3%A9), while the first film theatre to be introduced was "The Nickelodeon" in Pittsburgh(United States) 1905. Since then, film production and theaters have increased spontaneously till the 20th century, when the film industry worldwide has revenue of around 77B, [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/5431/film-production-worldwide/#topicOverview). The revenue generated from Movies is usually accumulated from the following sources ;
- Merchandising
- Television Broadcast
- Home video
- Theatre Exhibitions.

However, out of all these sources theatre exhibitions (aka box office) is the most used measure to assess the success of a movie, because of data availability compared to the other revenue sources.
Movies produced are usually categorized according to the style, theme, or scenes associated with the movie, such categories are called **genres**, few examples of movie genres are **Action, Thriller, Drama, Horror, and Comedy**.

## Data Understanding
***
The datasets used in this project were sourced from various movie databases and websites such as [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), and [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).The movie attributes of interest in our analysis are : ***movie titles , gross sales , production studios, producers, actors*** and **directors*** . The attributes are contained in two datasets namely; 

> The `bom.movie_gross.csv` which has 3387 movies (rows) and 5 movie attributes (columns). Each row represents a particular movie and its corresponding attribute, that is ; `title`, `studio`, `domestic_gross`, `foreign_gross` and `year`.

> The `im.db` is an SQLite database of IMDB data, that contains 8 tables that are linked together using primary and foreign keys. Each table contains different information corresponding to a particular movie title and movie_id  found in the `movie_basics` table. From this  database we are going to extract two tables:
- `movie_basics` table, which is a join of the `movie_basics` and `movie_ratings` tables and will have the following attributes {`movie_id`, `runtime_minute`, `primary_title` and `genres`}

- `persons` table, which is a join of the  `persons` and `principlas` tables and will have the following attributes {`person_id` , `primary_name`, `movie_id` and  `category`}

## Data Preparation
***
The data was checked for missing values duplicates and placeholders of missing data. The missing values were handled by dropping all the rows with them while duplicates were not found in our data. New columns were created from transforming existing columns and those columns that were not in their appropriate data type were cleaned and converted into their appropriate data type
